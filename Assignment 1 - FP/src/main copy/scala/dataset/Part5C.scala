   *
   * A day has different parts:
   *   Morning 5:00 am to 11:59 am
   *   Afternoon 12:00 pm to 4:59 pm
   *   Evening 5:00 pm to 8:59 pm
   *   Night 9:00 pm to 4:59 am
   *
   * Which part of the day was the most productive in terms of commits ?
   * Return a tuple with the part of the day and the number of commits
   *
   * Be careful, as the dates are represented in the ZonedDateTime format,
   * which contains information about timezone. You must consider the
   * times in the UTC timezone.
   *
   * Hint: for the time, use `SimpleDateFormat` and `SimpleTimeZone`.
