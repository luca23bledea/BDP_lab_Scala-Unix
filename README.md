# Big Data Processing – CSE2520 (TU Delft)

This repository contains the four programming assignments for the **Big Data Processing (CSE2520)** course at **TU Delft**.

The assignments progressively cover functional programming, Unix pipelines, distributed processing with Spark, and stream processing with Flink.

---

## 📌 Assignment 1 – Functional Programming (Scala)

**Focus:** Pure functional programming in Scala.

### Topics covered:
- Functions & lambdas  
- Pattern matching (no `var`, no loops)  
- Recursion  
- Restricted use of Scala List API  
- Functional data processing on real datasets  

### Key constraints:
- No mutation (`var` forbidden)  
- No `for` / `while` loops  
- Strict functional style required

## 🖥 Assignment 2 – Unix

**Focus:** Unix fundamentals and shell scripting.

### Parts:
1. Terminal basics & environment setup  
2. Pipelines for data manipulation  
3. Bash script automation  

### Skills developed:
- Command-line navigation  
- Combining Unix tools via pipelines  
- Writing reusable `.sh` scripts

## ⚡ Assignment 3 – Apache Spark

**Focus:** Distributed data processing using Spark (Scala, Java 8).

### Topics covered:
- RDD transformations & actions  
- Spark SQL & DataFrames  
- Lazy evaluation  
- Query optimization (Spark Catalyst)  

### Concepts practiced:
- Distributed computing model  
- Batch data processing  
- Working with structured data at scale

## 🌊 Assignment 4 – Apache Flink

**Focus:** Stream processing and event-driven analytics.

**Dataset:** GitHub commit streams  

### Topics covered:
- DataStream API  
- Stateful processing  
- Time-based window operations  
- Event-time handling  
- Stream joins  
- Complex Event Processing (CEP)  

### Core challenges:
- Aggregations over time windows  
- Sliding & tumbling windows  
- Weekly joins between streams  
- Pattern detection (files added and removed within 1 day)
